### 1. Crosschain Transactions

A DEMOS crosschain transcation contains instructions to execute a signed payload for [supported blockchains](../../cross-chain/#supported-blockchains) (eg. EVM, Solana, etc) via the DEMOS network.

Please refer to the [Crosschain transaction](../../cookbook/transactions/crosschain-transaction.md) section of the Cookbook.
